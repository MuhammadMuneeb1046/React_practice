This is a folder where all my react projects on which i have practiced are present.

The projects are all in the zip format as there are many files in a simple react project so first extract them.
Then after extracting the files open command prompt and run the command npm install or npm i. 
This will install all the dependencies or packages that i used in making these projects. 
Then open the folder in VS Code or any other coding software and open the terminal and run the npm run dev command which will run the project.

The assignment folders will be uploaded here also and the link of figma ui used to make those will be available here in this file.
